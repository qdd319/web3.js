## [4.0.1-alpha.1]

### Added

-   Added and exported three reusable utility functions: `pollTillDefined`, `rejectIfTimeout` and `rejectIfConditionAtInterval` which are useful when dealing with promises that involves polling, rejecting after timeout or rejecting if a condition was met when calling repeatably at every time intervals.

## [4.0.1-alpha.2]

### Added

-   Export a new function `uuidV4` that generates a random v4 Uuid (#5373).
-   Enable passing a starting number, to increment based on it, for the Json Rpc Request `id` (#5652).
-   Export a new function `isPromise` that checks if an object is a promise (#5652).

### Fixed

-   Use Uuid for the response id, to fix the issue "Responses get mixed up due to conflicting payload IDs" (#5373).
